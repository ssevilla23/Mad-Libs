# 📝Mad-Libs Project

The Mad-Libs project is an interactive website that
mimics the classic Mad Libs game with one generated story.
Users can input various words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.),
and the website will generate a funny, personalized story based
on their entries. This project was completed as an academic assignment
and was developed by me using JavaScript.
